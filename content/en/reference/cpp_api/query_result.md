# QueryResult

**Full name:** `neug::QueryResult`

Lightweight wrapper around protobuf `QueryResponse`.

``QueryResult`` stores a full query response and exposes utility methods for:
- constructing from serialized protobuf bytes (``From()``),
- obtaining row count (``length()``),
- accessing response schema (``result_schema()``),
- serializing/deserializing (``Serialize()`` / ``From()``),
- debugging output (``ToString()``),
- cursor-based row traversal via ``hasNext()`` / ``next()``,
- typed cell access via ``GetInt32()``, ``GetString()``, etc.

**Typed accessors:** Every getter reads from the current cursor row and has two overloads, by column index or by column name. Call `IsNull(...)` before reading a cell that may be NULL. Temporal columns (`date`, `timestamp`, `interval`) are not exposed as dedicated typed objects: use `GetString(...)` for their canonical string form (e.g. `"1970-01-01"`) and `GetInt64(...)` for the raw epoch value of `date` / `timestamp` columns.

**Example:** 
```cpp
auto result = QueryResult::From(serialized);
// Access by column index
while (result.hasNext()) {
    if (!result.IsNull(0)) {
        int32_t id = result.GetInt32(0);
        std::string name = result.GetString(1);
    }
    result.next();
}
// Access by column name
result.Reset();
while (result.hasNext()) {
    if (!result.IsNull("id")) {
        int32_t id = result.GetInt32("id");
        std::string name = result.GetString("name");
        double score = result.GetDouble("score");
    }
    result.next();
}
```

### Public Methods

#### `hasNext() const`

Check whether there are more rows to consume.

#### `next()`

Advance the cursor to the next row.

Throws if no more rows are available (check `hasNext()` first).

#### `Reset()`

Reset the internal cursor back to the first row.

#### `CurrentRowIndex() const`

Return the current cursor position (0-based row index).

#### `IsNull(size_t column_index) const`

Check whether the cell at current row is NULL.

- **Parameters:**
  - `column_index`: Zero-based column index.

#### `IsNull(const std::string &column_name) const`

Check whether the named cell at current row is NULL.

- **Parameters:**
  - `column_name`: Column name from the result schema.

#### `GetInt32(size_t column_index) const`

Return the current cell as a signed 32-bit integer.

The source column must have type int32 or `bool`. Any other source type causes an exception. An int32 value is returned unchanged; a `bool` value is converted to 1 or 0.

  - `column_index`: Zero-based column index.

#### `GetInt32(const std::string &column_name) const`

Return the named current cell as a signed 32-bit integer.

- **Parameters:**
  - `column_name`: Column name from the result schema.

#### `GetUInt32(size_t column_index) const`

Return the current cell as an unsigned 32-bit integer.

#### `GetInt64(size_t column_index) const`

Return the current cell as a signed 64-bit integer.

The source column must have type int64, int32, uint32, `bool`, date, or timestamp. Any other source type causes an exception. Smaller integers are widened, `bool` is converted to 1 or 0, and date and timestamp values are returned as their raw stored epoch values.
